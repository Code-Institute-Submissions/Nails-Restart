Project title: 
Nails 

Overview:
This website is for a business owner who is setting up a nail salon in the local area. The aim of the client would be to get customers in the door, and also create some 
bookings online so people don't have to come into store to make appointments. They want customers to be able to send in messages through the website, basically informing 
the business owner of what they want done and when. This would lead to the business owner giving the customer a call back just to make the whole process feel a bit more personal.
They want also for customers to be able to have a look at their portolio, too see the their professonial skill and boost sales.

UX:
This website is aimed at woman aged 17-45. Although this is a wide range, women of younger and older will also want the service but we can recognise that this will be the 
main bulk of the cosumers coming through the site. Baring this in mind you can't generally group the target market into one category of style as the range of consumers will 
be so wide. Based on this I have conducted some market reasearch into other websites with the same goal, also I have spoken to a few potential customers varying in age and 
background. 

User comments:
Client 1 "I would like to see an inviting and colourful site with photos to see what the works like" 
Client 2 "I would like to be able to see where the shop is located so I could go down and check it myself" 
Client 3 "I wanna see pictures of the work as I have been to a couple shops and not been satified with the outcome" 
client 4 "Personally I wanna be able see contact details so I can get in contact with the salon directly"
client 5 "I am constantly on social media so if the shop had online presence I would like to be able to look at it" 

I have come up with a basic wire frame idea based on these ideas. You can find this at <a href="/assets/wireframes/wireframe-nails.pdf"></a>

Features:
Based on my UX research I believe I will need to include these features:-

-Fullscreen picture as the home page of a manicure. This will allow users to instantly know what the website is about and not be confused. 

-Links to social media at the footer of every page. This will allow users to navigate to social accounts and possible find out more information about the 
client more easily and effiently. 

-Scrolling (left-right) photo gallery showing off clients work. This will allow users to see the clients work without making the page look messy. It will 
also be easy for users to navigate through the photos.

-Contact form allowing users to give their names; contact number; email and a breif overview of what they want done or any questions they may have. This will allow
our client too not only get an idea of customers problems or queries but also make arranging appointments easier. 

-(not 100%$) Could include a map of where the shop is based although I'm not 100% I have the skills to this just a thought for later

Technologies Used: 

Bootstrap:- 
<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/"></a> -- I have used bootstrap for the basic structure of the website. Taking advantage of it's powerful preset CSS 
functionality. Although I have used bootstrap to help with the layout I have manipulated and personalised the preset CSS with my own custon coding. 

Google Fonts:- 
<a href="https://fonts.google.com/"></a> -- I have used google fonts, importing the style directly into the css stylesheet. I have simply used this service as a means to get custom fonts. 

Google Maps:- 
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps"></a> -- I have used google maps embedding feature to embed a map of the shop so customers can easily find out where exactly it is they have to go. 

Font Awesome:-
<a href="https://fontawesome.com/"></a> -- I used font awesome for it's easily accesable icons.

Testing: 

Test 1:-

What? -- Testing the asthetics and fluidity of the webpage.
How? -- Using google chromes developer tools I was able to make sure the website had the same feeling across many different devices, including iphone, samsung, ipad ect. 
Why? -- I did this to ensure that no matter what angle ( or size ;) ) the user was looking at the website they where able to enjoy the content of the website. 
When? -- When people visit the site the most they have to click is twice to get to where they want to be and this even takes effect on mobile and smaller resolution screens. 
From the mobile interface you simply need to click the down arrow to reveal the hidden links and choose where on the website you would like to go and tests have been done
to ensure all the links work consistently and across every page of the website. Within a desktop or higher resolution screens the user is invited with a simple nav-bar
and no matter where on the website they are; they're only a click away from where they want to be next. I have achieved this through fixing the nav-bar to the top of the 
screen so even on the pages where user can scroll down the web page the links to their next location are always visible. Although I thought about having the footer always 
visible, through the consistent testing of how the page looks across all platforms, I decided to make it so the footer was static and felt this made the page look more 
proffesional. Even if a user doesn't scroll to the bottom of the page however they are still only two clicks away from and social media links. 

Test 2:-
What? -- Testing the functionality. 
How? -- I have done this by making testing every single link and button on each of the pages within the website. I also have been testing out the form on the contact page
but for some reason I cannot get it throw me out an error if someone doesn't type in their email address correctly. I also can't figure out how it will throw out and success 
modal or something to confirm to the user that their email has been sent. 
Why? -- To make sure that the website functions properly and is user friendly giving positive feedback and easy naviagtion.
